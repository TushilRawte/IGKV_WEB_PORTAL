                        On the auspicious occasion of Chhattisgarh's first festival, Akhti, a mobile application for agricultural employment has been developed in collaboration with Indira Gandhi Agricultural University and NIC to increase the income and provide employment to farmer brothers and their families. Through this application, farmer brothers will be able to share their innovative efforts. The concept of the agricultural employment mobile app is inspired by the target set by the Honorable Ex-Chief Minister, Mr. Bhupesh Baghel, to provide 1.5 million jobs under the Chhattisgarh Employment Mission.

Through this app, farmers skilled in traditional farming, technically proficient farmer brothers, advisors skilled in various agricultural fields, and entrepreneurs who have established various agricultural industries can register themselves or as a group in the app. Subsequently, the farming community will be able to benefit from the agricultural services provided by this application.

With this new initiative, farmers and the youth of Chhattisgarh will be able to gain information and employment opportunities related to secondary agricultural activities such as technical proficiency, dairy farming, fish farming, poultry farming, beekeeping, and other farming-related activities. Through this app, both job providers and seekers among the farmer brothers will be able to easily connect with each other and obtain employment according to their qualifications, thereby increasing their income.
